Task 1: Exploring Data Science Applications
What I Learned:
I discovered various unconventional applications of data science, including its use in sports analytics, fraud detection, and smart cities. I gained insights into how predictive analytics helps in decision-making across industries.  
Difficulties Faced: 
Finding less common applications required in-depth research. Understanding the technical aspects of implementation in different domains was challenging.  
Final Thought:  
This task broadened my perspective on the versatility of data science and its impact on diverse fields. 

Task 2: AI, ML, and DL Relationship Visualization 
What I Learned:
I deepened my understanding of how AI encompasses both Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The visualization clarified how different ML techniques, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, fit within AI.  
Difficulties Faced: 
Creating a diagram that is both visually appealing and informative was tricky. Striking a balance between simplicity and detail was a challenge.  
Final Thought: 
Representing knowledge through visuals enhances comprehension, and I plan to incorporate more diagrams in my learning process.  

Task 3: Understanding Data Science Roles
What I Learned: 
Data Science roles vary significantly, with some focusing on data engineering, analytics, or business intelligence. I also explored specialized roles like Machine Learning Engineer and Data Analyst, noting their unique skill requirements.  
Difficulties Faced:  
Distinguishing between overlapping responsibilities, especially between Data Engineers and Data Scientists, was difficult. Summarizing complex roles concisely was another challenge.  
Final Thought: 
Beyond technical expertise, strong analytical and problem-solving skills play a crucial role in a data science career.  

Task 4: Practical Example of Data Science Lifecycle 
What I Learned:  
The data science lifecycle follows a well-structured path, from problem identification to model deployment. I examined how industries implement this lifecycle, such as in customer churn prediction.  
Difficulties Faced:  
Breaking down real-world problems into distinct lifecycle stages was challenging. Understanding the nuances of feature engineering and how it differs from preprocessing required additional study.  
Final Thought:  
Applying theoretical concepts to real-world cases improved my understanding of the step-by-step approach in data science projects.
