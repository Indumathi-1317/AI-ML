**Review from an Average Studentâ€™s Perspective**

## **Task 1: Data Science Applications Brainstorm**  
### **What I Learned:**  
- I explored real-world applications of data science beyond the standard examples.  
- It was fascinating to see how fields like sports analytics, agriculture, and cybersecurity leverage data science.  

### **Difficulties Faced:**  
- Finding unique applications beyond what was discussed in class was challenging.  
- Understanding how data science is specifically applied in different industries required additional research.  

### **Final Thought:**  
This task helped me move beyond textbook knowledge and appreciate the diverse real-world applications of data science.

## **Task 2: AI, ML, DL Relationship Diagram**  
### **What I Learned:**  
- I now understand the hierarchy of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL).  
- Creating a diagram made it easier to visualize that ML is a subset of AI, and DL is a subset of ML.  

### **Difficulties Faced:**  
- Designing a neat and visually clear diagram was difficult.  
- Simplifying the explanation while maintaining accuracy was a challenge.  

### **Final Thought:**  
Visualizing concepts enhances understanding. I plan to use more diagrams in my studies.

## **Task 3: Data Scientist Roles Research**  
### **What I Learned:**  
- A Data Scientist's role is not just about building modelsâ€”it also involves data cleaning, visualization, and business communication.  
- Different roles exist within Data Science, and not all require heavy coding.  

### **Difficulties Faced:**  
- Differentiating similar roles, such as Data Scientist vs. Data Engineer, required careful comparison.  
- Writing concise yet informative descriptions was tricky.  

### **Final Thought:**  
Data Science is not just about coding; business understanding and problem-solving are equally important.

## **Task 4: Data Science Lifecycle Example**  
### **What I Learned:**  
- Data Science follows a structured lifecycle, from problem identification to model deployment.  
- Model evaluation and improvement are crucial steps even after training.  

### **Difficulties Faced:**  
- Breaking down a real-world scenario into each lifecycle step was challenging.  
- Differentiating between data preprocessing and feature engineering was difficult.  

### **Final Thought:**  
Building a model is just one step; understanding the full data science workflow is essential.  

---

## **Task 5: Data Science Ethics Discussion**  
### **What I Learned:**  
- Ethics in Data Science is crucial, especially regarding AI bias, data privacy, and accountability.  
- Even well-designed AI models can have unintended negative consequences.  

### **Difficulties Faced:**  
- Choosing one major ethical concern was tough since all were important.  
- Presenting the issue in a balanced way without personal bias was challenging.  

### **Final Thought:**  
AI is powerful, but responsible use is necessary to prevent harm and ensure fairness.  

---

## **Bonus Task: Data Science Career Paths**  
### **What I Learned:**  
- Data Science offers multiple career paths, some focused on coding (ML Engineer) and others on insights (Data Analyst).  
- Data Engineering plays a vital role but differs significantly from a Data Scientist's responsibilities.  

### **Difficulties Faced:**  
- Understanding overlapping job roles required careful research.  
- Job titles and responsibilities vary across companies, making it hard to define clear distinctions.  

### **Final Thought:**  
There are many career options in Data Science. I need to explore further to find the best fit for me.
